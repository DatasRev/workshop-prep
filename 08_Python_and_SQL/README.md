Balazs Balogh's part:

You need to install the SQLite3 database to your computer. If you like GUIs, then install SQLiteStudio or use https://sqliteonline.com/, which is an online database manager. For instructions, use http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/.
As far as I know, Anaconda comes with the sqlite and sqlalchemy packages, so you don't have to install those.
If you don't have them, in the anaconda command prompt type: conda install sqlite and press 'Y' when prompted. After it finishes, conda install sqlalchemy, and again, 'Y'.

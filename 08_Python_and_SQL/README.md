Balazs Balogh's part:

If you'd like to see the database in an editor, download SQLiteStudio (https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt?act=download), or attach the database to https://sqliteonline.com/ after first run.
You will need the folium package for presenting the data on the map. To download it, put 

conda install -c conda-forge folium

to your Anaconda Command Prompt.
SQLite3 comes with the Jupyter Notebook, no need for installation.
